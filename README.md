Carp is a small programming language designed to work well for interactive and performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:

* No garbage collection or runtime system, all memory management is deterministic and compiled into the final binary executable
* Static (100% inferred) type system that enables very fast code execution and fewer runtime errors
* Dynamic code loading and execution enables interactive (REPL-driven) development of your program
* No hidden performance penalties, everything that can slow down your program is explicit and visible in the code
* Ownership system that enables a functional programming style with the performance characteristics of C
* Very good integration with C libraries

## The Language
Carp is heavily inspired by languages like Clojure, Scheme, Haskell & ML. Here's a sample program:

```clojure
(defn main ()
  (println "Hello!"))
```

## The Compiler
Carp is very tightly integrated with it's compiler which itself is written in a dynamic version of Carp (the dynamic version is implemented in C). To compile or work on a Carp program you start the Carp compiler system which puts you in the compiler REPL. Everything you want to do with your program can be controlled from here.
