## The Compiler
The Carp language is very tightly integrated with the REPL, everything you want to do to your program can be controlled from here.

To explore the commands available, enter ```(help)``` and press enter.

<!-- ### Special Files -->
<!-- If a file called ```user.carp``` is placed in the folder ```~/.carp/```, that file will get loaded after the compiler has started. This file is meant for user specific settings that you want in all your projects, like little helper functions and other customizations. -->

<!-- If a file called ```project.carp``` is placed in the folder where you invoke the ```carp``` command this file will get loaded after the compiler has started (and after 'user.carp' has loaded). This files is intended for setting up the build process of this particular project, for example by loading the correct source files, configuring the compiler variables, etc. -->
