;; The dependency graph
;;
;; Nodes are functions, groups of mutually recursive functions, modules, structs, etc.
;; Each node can be compiled into its own dynamic library and depends on a set of other nodes.
;; Compiling a node should be very straight forward:
;;
;;  (bake-node "foo")
;;
;; The whole graph lives in a data structure called 'graph' which is a big dictionary.
